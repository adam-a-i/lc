Meeting Rooms II
Solved 
Given an array of meeting time interval objects consisting of start and end times [[start_1,end_1],[start_2,end_2],...] (start_i < end_i), find the minimum number of days required to schedule all meetings without any conflicts.

Note: (0,8),(8,10) is not considered a conflict at 8.

Example 1:

Input: intervals = [(0,40),(5,10),(15,20)]

Output: 2
Explanation:
day1: (0,40)
day2: (5,10),(15,20)

Example 2:

Input: intervals = [(4,9)]

Output: 1
Constraints:

0 <= intervals.length <= 500
0 <= intervals[i].start < intervals[i].end <= 1,000,000

# Min-heap stores end times of ongoing meetings.
# Heap[0] = earliest ending meeting (the room that frees first).
# For each meeting:
#   - If start >= heap[0], reuse that room (pop & push new end).
#   - Else, conflict â†’ need new room (push new end).
# Heap size at any moment = number of rooms in use.
# Max heap size reached = minimum rooms required.
